# Lab-1-Alice-Li

## Project Goal
This project focuses on implementing basic 2D interactions in Godot. The main objectives are:

1. Enable the icon to move up, down, left, and right.  
2. Add collision detection between the icon and tree objects, so the icon stops when it hits a tree.  
3. Understand the hierarchy of nodes, for example, ensuring the background is placed at the top of the list.

## Issues Encountered
During development, I faced the following challenges:

1. **Node type and script conflicts**: Certain scripts could not be assigned to specific node types, causing errors.  
2. **Improper child node ordering**: Misordered nodes made transformations and scene adjustments very confusing.

## Notes
This lab helps me get familiar with Godot's node system, collision setup, and basic 2D movement mechanics.
